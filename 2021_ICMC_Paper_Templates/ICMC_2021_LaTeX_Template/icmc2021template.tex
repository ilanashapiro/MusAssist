\begin{abstract}
MusAssist is an external, declarative domain specific language for music notation. 
Users can change key signatures, start a new measure, and describe musical structures 
such as notes, rests, and custom chords in MusAssist’s straightforward syntax much in 
the same way they would when composing. MusAssist is unique in that users can also describe 
complex musical templates for triads and seventh chords, cadences, and the four primary 
harmonic sequences with desired length. The level of abstraction of a MusAssist template 
MusAssist matches that of the theoretical musical structure it describes (e.g. users can describe
 a harmonic sequence without lowering the abstraction level to chords and notes). This allows 
 users to write out specifications precisely at the conceptual levels of the musical structures 
 they would organically conceive when composing by hand. The musical expressions described by 
 the specifications are expanded out (i.e. the level of abstraction is fully lowered) by the 
 Haskell-based MusAssist compiler and are translated to MusicXML, a language accepted by most 
 major notation software, allowing for further manual editing. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
When writing music, composers must manually transition from musical theoretical concepts to notes on a page.
This process can be tedious and slow, requiring the composer to expand complex structures, such as cadences and sequences,
by hand to the notes that they constitute. The level of abstraction of the musical theoretical structure is 
higher than what the composer actually writes. 
MusAssist, an external, declarative domain specific language (DSL) for music notation, attempts bridge the divide between
theory and notation. Users describe a composition in MusAssist's straightforward syntax, and the MusAssist compiler writes out the 
music via these instructions.

Fundamentally, MusAssist supports notes (including rests) and custom chords (i.e. any desired collection of notes)
in the octave and key of choice, as well as change the key signature or start a new measure at any
point. MusAssist is unique in that users can also write specifications for complex musical templates \textit{at the same level of abstraction
as the musical theoretical structures they describe}. MusAssist supports \textbf{chords} (all triads and seventh chords in any inversion), \textbf{cadences}
(perfect authentic, imperfect authentic, plagal, half, deceptive), and \textbf{harmonic sequences} (ascending
fifths, descending fifths, ascending 5-6, descending 5-6) of a desired length. The musical expression 
described by this specification is completely expanded out (i.e. the level of abstraction is
fully lowered) by the Haskell-based MusAssist compiler.

The target language of the MusAssist compiler is MusicXML, itself a DSL that is an extension of
XML (Extensible Markup Language). MusicXML is accepted by most major notation software programs (such as MuseScore). 
Thus users can open can open the resulting MusicXML file of a compiled MusAssist composition in MuseScore or another
program for further customization and editing, thus bypassing the need to write out complex musical templates by hand at a 
note- and chord-level of abstraction. Beyond a professional music compositional aid, MusAssist may be particularly 
helpful to music theory students as an educational tool, enabling them to visualize the relationship between a theortical musical structure 
and its expanded form, such as a cadence and the chords resulting from its expansion.


\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related_work}

The era of music DSLs began in 2008 with Ge Wang's ChucK audio processing language, which  
spans the application domains of ``methods for sound synthesis, physical modeling of real-time world artifacts and spaces (e.g., 
musical instruments, environmental sounds), analysis and information retrieval of sound and music, to 
mapping and crafting of new controllers and interfaces (both software and physical) for music, 
algorithmic/generative processes for automated or semi-automatic composition and accompaniment, [and] 
real-time music performance." %\citeparen{wang_2008}. 
Since then, researchers have taken advantage of the increased flexibility afforded to DSLs via their limited expressiveness to create
music DSLs tailored towards notation, algorithmic composition, signal processing, live coding with music performance, and more. In the 
 notation domain, MusicXML and LilyPond stand out.

Michael Good's MusicXML is an Internet-friendly, XML-based, declarative DSL capable of representing Western music 
notation and sheet music since c. 1600. 
It acts as an "interchange format for applications in music notation, music analysis, music information retrieval, 
and musical performance," thus supporting sharing between specialized applications. %\cite{good_2013}

MusicXML attempts to emulate for online sheet music and music software what the popular MIDI format 
did for electronic instruments. It is derived from XML in order to help solve the music 
interchange problem: to create a standardized method to represent complex, structured data in order to support 
smooth interchange between "musical notation, performance, analysis, and retrieval applications." XML has the 
desired qualities of "straightforward usability over the Internet, ease of creating documents, and human readability" 
that translate directly into the musical domain, and it is more powerful and expressive 
than MIDI. %\cite{good_2001}

MusicXML is more expressive than MusAssist, but the
level of abstraction of all musical elements is extremely low (i.e. chords must be written out 
as individual notes) and its syntax is very difficult and tedious to write by hand. However,
its flexibility and expressiveness make MusicXML an excellent target 
compilation language for MusAssist's user-friendly syntax and high-level musical theoretical templates.

LilyPond, an external declarative DSL created by Han-Wen Nienhuys and 
Jan Nieuwenhuizen, is more similar to MusAssist. It features a "modular, extensible and programmable 
compiler" written in Scheme to generate music notation of excellent quality and supports the mixing of text and music elements. 
Text-based \textit{musical expressions}, or fragments of music with 
set durations, are compiled to an aesthetically formatted score.

LilyPond and MusAssist are both music notation DSLs tailored to non-programming audiences. However, 
they differ in two fundamental areas: 
(1) MusAssist is more expressive than LilyPond as it supports complex music templates at the levels of abstraction of the 
musical structures they represent and (2) the output of the MusAssist compiler is intentionally editable via
notation software (unlike LilyPond's compiler, which produces a static, printable PostScript or PDF file by 
taking in a file with a formal representation of the desired music).

\section{Typeset Text}\label{sec:typeset_text}

\subsection{Normal or Body Text}\label{subsec:body}
Please use a 10~pt (point) Times family font (i.e., Times New Roman). Sans-serif fonts or non-proportional fonts can be used only for special purposes, such as distinguishing source code text.

The first paragraph in each section should not be indented, but all other paragraphs should be. (Again, these have all been set in the styles provided.)

% this inserts a column-break
%\pagebreak

\subsection{Title and Authors}
The title is 16~pt Times, bold, upper case, centered. Authors' names are centered. The lead author's name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names after. If the addresses for all authors are the same, include the address only once, centered. If the authors have different addresses, put the addresses, evenly spaced, under each authors' name.

\subsection{First Page Copyright Notice}
Please include the copyright notice exactly as it appears here in the lower left-hand corner of the page. It is set in 8~pt Times, one column in width, and should not descend into the  page margins (i.e. it should keep clear of the 1" margin at the bottom of the page).

\subsection{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}
Do not include headers, footers or page numbers in your submission. These will be added when the publications are assembled.

\section{Headings}
First level headings are in Times 12pt bold, centered with 1 line of space above the section head, and 1/2 space below it.  For a section header immediately followed by a subsection header, the space should be merged.

\subsection{Second Level Headings}
Second level headings are in Times 10~pt bold, flush left,
with 1 line of space above the section head, and 1/2 space below it.
The first letter of each significant word is capitalized.

\subsubsection{Third and further Level Headings}
Third level headings are in Times 10~pt italic, flush left, with 1/2 line of space above the section head, and 1/2 space below it. The first letter of each significant word is capitalized.

Using more than three levels of headings is strongly discouraged.

\pagebreak

\section{Equations, Figures, Footnotes}

\subsection{Equations}
Equations should be placed on separated lines and numbered.
The number should be on the right side, in parentheses.
\begin{equation}
E=mc^{2}.
\label{eq:Emc2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Captions}
All artwork must be centered, neat, clean, and legible. All lines should be very dark for purposes of reproduction and artwork should not be hand-drawn. The proceedings will be distributed in electronic form only, therefore color figures are allowed. However, you may want to check that your figures are understandable even if they are printed in black-and-white.
\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  String Value & Numeric value \\
  \hline
  Hello ICMC & 2021 \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}
 \caption{Table captions should be placed below the table.}
 \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

Numbers and captions of figures and tables always appear below the figure/table. Leave 1 line space between the figure or table and the caption. Figure and tables are numbered consecutively. Captions should be Times 10~pt. Place tables/figures in text as close to the reference as possible, and preferably at the top of the page.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figure.eps}
\caption{Figure captions are placed below the figure, exactly like this.\label{fig:example}}
\end{figure}

Always refer to tables and figures in the main text, for example:
see Figure \ref{fig:example} and \tabref{tab:example}. 
Place Tables/Figures in text as close to the reference as possible.
Figures and tables may extend across both columns to a maximum width of 17.2cm.

Vectorial figures are preferred. 
When using {\texttt{Matlab}}, 
export using either Postscript or PDF format. 
Also, in order to optimize readability, the font size of text within a figure should be at list identical to footnote font size. If bitmap figures are used, please make sure that the resolution is enough for print quality. 

\subsection{Footnotes}
Indicate footnotes with a number in the text.\footnote{This is a footnote.}
Use 8~pt type for footnotes. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page 
on which they appear. 
Precede the footnote with a 0.5~pt horizontal rule.

%\newpage

\section{Citations}
All bibliographical references should be listed at the end, inside a section named ``REFERENCES''.

References must be numbered {\ul {in order of appearance}}, {\em not} alphabetically. Please avoid listing references that do not appear in the text.

Reference numbers in the text should appear within square brackets, such as 
in~\cite{Someone:09} or~\cite{Someone:04,Someone:13}.

The reference format is the standard IEEE one. We recommend using BibTeX to create the reference list.
